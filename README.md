# Vermilions-Items
Random collection of this and that for C:DDA

Thought I’d give modding a go since I haven’t had much to do lately. Don’t expect a high quality mod. This is held together with chewed gum and toothpicks.

WHAT THE MOD ADDS:

    High-frequency blade
    A powerful and rare end game katana found rarely in vaults and labs.

    Augmented Swordplay martial art + book
    A style specific to the high-frequency blade only. About as rare as the blade in drops.

    PTRS-41 anti-tank rifle + ammo + magazine + casing + reloaded ammo
    Slightly more powerful and heavier and more cumbersome than the Barrett .50cal. Should be a fairly rare item.

    Kantele
    A Finnish pluck string instrument found in music shops and houses. Works like any other musical instrument.

    Egg vibrator
    Lighter alternative to the vibrator. Holds only 50 batteries.


TO DO:

    Make shockers drop a special item that restores health when killed in Augmented Swordplay, if that even is possible.
    More items when not lazy.
